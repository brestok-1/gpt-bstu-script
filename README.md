# <div align="center">ChatGPT script üìù</div>

## Description

In practice, I was given a task at university to divide a writer's 80-page work into blocks of approximately 200 words.
Then, I had to analyze each block and identify the two most suitable themes out of forty. I found this task very silly
for my specialization, so I wrote a script that does all of this for me. Then, I was able to sell it to my classmates
and make enough money.

You can use this script to analyze the text by changing the values of WORD_COUNT and changing the query for ChatGPT.

In this project, I wrote several functions that divide text into blocks. The condition was that each block ended with a
sentence-ending symbol (?, !, ., ..., and others). I split the text into words using regular expressions and found the
last word for each block. Understanding that the text was large, I also obtained the previous and next words to ensure
that I was cutting the text in the right place. And then, finding the index of occurrence, cut the text, getting the
necessary block. Next, I created a request for ChatGPT, sent it to the Open AI server, used a model for
text analysis (text-davinci-003), and saved the resulting responses to a file.

## Project setup

***Method 1: Via docker-compose***

1. Create a .env file and paste the data from the .env.example file into it
2. In REDIS_HOST and POSTGRES_HOST, specify the names of docker-compose services (redis and db)
3. In BOT_TOKEN, specify the token of your telegram bot created earlier via BotFather
4. In the terminal, enter the following command:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

***Method 2: Via virtual environment***

1. Create and activate a python virtual environment
2. In the terminal, enter the following command:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a .env file and paste the data from the .env.example file into it
4. In REDIS_HOST and POSTGRES_HOST, specify localhost
5. In BOT_TOKEN, specify the token of your telegram bot created earlier via BotFather
6. Run the file bot.py
